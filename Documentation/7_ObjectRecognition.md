## Using the RbpyCam


```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import rospy
from sensor_msgs.msg import Image
from cv_bridge import CvBridge, CvBridgeError
import cv2
import numpy as np
```
**Capturing an image from the camera**

We gonna create a class for encapsuling the attributes and callback function:

```python
class TakeAShot(object):

 def __init__(self):
        self.image_sub = rospy.Subscriber("/camera/rgb/image_raw", Image, self.camera_callback)
        self.bridge_object = CvBridge()
```
The callback function will recieve the Image object from the camera in a missage and then it will save the Image as a png file in your 

```python
 def camera_callback(self,data):
      try:
           # We select bgr8 because its the OpenCV encoding by default
           cv_image = self.bridge_object.imgmsg_to_cv2(data, desired_encoding="bgr8")
           cv2.imwrite("image.png", cv_image)
      except CvBridgeError as e:
           print(e)        
```     		
The main is as usual:

```python
def main():

    rospy.init_node('take_a_shot', anonymous=True)
    take_a_shot = TakeAShot()
    try:
        rospy.spin()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Shutting down")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```


### Final Exercise

* Load the room map 
* Start the navigation stack. 
* Get the coordinates of all the traffic sign using Rviz.
* Write a Python node with the folowing behaviour:
	* Go to the first sign.
	* When the robot stops:
		* take an image. 
		* recognize the object using image processing by coulour and shape. 
		* go to next sign according the signs:
			* Left: go to next sign on the left
			* Right: go to next sign on the right
			* STOP: Shutdown node.
			* Forbidden: continues to the next sign

### Using TensorFlow for object recognition instead of Processing Image.

* Load the room map 
* Start the navigation stack. 
* Write a Python node with the folowing behaviour:
	* Do a random walk until the robot finds a sign, execute TensorFlow model and do inference on each image
		* go to next sign according the signs:
			* Left: go to next sign on the left
			* Right: go to next sign on the right
			* STOP: Shutdown node.
			* Forbidden: continues to the next sign  

### How to train and use a TensorFlow model for object recognition:
* Go to https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ and create an image project.
* Collect images with your mobile for each sign and upload them to the project.
* Train the model.
* Export the model as a keras .h5 model: 
* Install Keras in the Robot: `sudo pip install keras`
* Create a ROS node that uses the model for inference:
  
```python

from keras.models import load_model  # TensorFlow is required for Keras to work
import cv2  # Install opencv-python
import numpy as np

# Disable scientific notation for clarity
np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)

# Load the model
model = load_model("keras_Model.h5", compile=False)

# Load the labels
class_names = open("labels.txt", "r").readlines()

# CAMERA can be 0 or 1 based on default camera of your computer
camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    # Grab the webcamera's image.
    ret, image = camera.read()

    # Resize the raw image into (224-height,224-width) pixels
    image = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)

    # Show the image in a window
    cv2.imshow("Webcam Image", image)

    # Make the image a numpy array and reshape it to the models input shape.
    image = np.asarray(image, dtype=np.float32).reshape(1, 224, 224, 3)

    # Normalize the image array
    image = (image / 127.5) - 1

    # Predicts the model
    prediction = model.predict(image)
    index = np.argmax(prediction)
    class_name = class_names[index]
    confidence_score = prediction[0][index]

    # Print prediction and confidence score
    print("Class:", class_name[2:], end="")
    print("Confidence Score:", str(np.round(confidence_score * 100))[:-2], "%")

    # Listen to the keyboard for presses.
    keyboard_input = cv2.waitKey(1)

    # 27 is the ASCII for the esc key on your keyboard.
    if keyboard_input == 27:
        break

camera.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
